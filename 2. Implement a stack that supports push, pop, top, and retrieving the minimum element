Implement a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element 

public class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> stack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;

    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }

    // Push element onto stack
    public void push(int x) {
        stack.push(x);

        // If minStack is empty or new element is <= current min, push it
        if (minStack.isEmpty() || x <= minStack.peek()) {
            minStack.push(x);
        }
    }

    // Pop element from stack
    public void pop() {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is empty.");
            return;
        }
        int removed = stack.pop();

        // If removed element is the current min, pop from minStack too
        if (removed == minStack.peek()) {
            minStack.pop();
        }
    }

    // Get top element
    public int top() {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is empty.");
            return -1;
        }
        return stack.peek();
    }

    // Retrieve minimum element in constant time
    public int getMin() {
        if (minStack.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is empty.");
            return -1;
        }
        return minStack.peek();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
        minStack.push(5);
        minStack.push(3);
        minStack.push(7);
        minStack.push(2);

        System.out.println("Current Min: " + minStack.getMin()); // 2

        minStack.pop(); // removes 2
        System.out.println("Current Min: " + minStack.getMin()); // 3

        System.out.println("Top Element: " + minStack.top());    // 7
    }
}
How It Works
stack → Stores all pushed elements.

minStack → Stores the minimum element so far at each push.

When you push():

Push to main stack.

Push to minStack if it’s empty or value ≤ current min.

When you pop():

Remove from main stack.

If removed element equals minStack.peek(), pop from minStack too.

getMin() → Always O(1) because we just peek minStack.

If you want, I can also give you a space-optimized Min Stack version that doesn’t use an extra stack but still gets O(1) min retrieval — interviewers often find that impressive.
Do you want me to prepare that?

convert this code in java and also fix error the question is Given a positive integer n, there exists a 0-indexed array called powers, composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [lefti, righti]. Each queries[i] represents a query where you have to find the product of all powers[j] with lefti <= j <= righti.

Return an array answers, equal in length to queries, where answers[i] is the answer to the ith query. Since the answer to the ith query may be too large, each answers[i] should be returned modulo 109 + 7.

Alright, Nidhi — let’s first understand the problem clearly, then I’ll give you the fixed and converted Java solution.

Understanding the Problem
You’re given an integer n.

Create an array powers that contains the minimum number of powers of 2 summing to n.

Example: n = 10 → powers = [2, 8] (because 2 + 8 = 10, minimal count, sorted ascending).

You’re given queries[i] = [left, right].

For each query, find the product of powers from left to right in powers.

Since results can be large → return mod 10^9 + 7.

Steps to Solve
Find powers array:

Decompose n into powers of 2 (using bit manipulation or greedy subtraction).

Store in ascending order.

Answer queries:

For each [l, r], multiply elements from index l to r.

Apply modulo after each multiplication.

Java Code
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.*;

public class PowersOfTwoQueries {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public static List<Long> productQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        // Step 1: Build powers array (ascending order)
        List<Long> powers = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) { // int up to 2^30
            if ((n & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                powers.add((long) (1 << i));
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Answer queries
        List<Long> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] q : queries) {
            int left = q[0];
            int right = q[1];
            long product = 1;

            for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
                product = (product * powers.get(i)) % MOD;
            }
            result.add(product);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        int[][] queries = { {0, 1}, {1, 1} };

        List<Long> ans = productQueries(n, queries);
        System.out.println(ans); // Output: [16, 8]
    }
}
Example Walkthrough
Input:
lua
Copy
Edit
n = 10 → binary 1010 → powers = [2, 8]
queries = [[0,1], [1,1]]
Query 0: 2 × 8 = 16 → 16 % (1e9+7) = 16

Query 1: 8 = 8

Output: [16, 8]

If you want, I can optimize this to handle up to 10^5 queries using prefix products so we don’t multiply repeatedly in each query — that will make it O(1) per query instead of O(k).

Do you want me to make that optimized version?

they give us method like array  public int[] productQueries(int n, int[][] queries) { }not list format

Got it ✅
You want the same solution but returning int[] instead of List<Long> — I’ll convert it and keep everything correct for Java.

Fixed Java Code
java
Copy
Edit
public class PowersOfTwoQueries {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int[] productQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        // Step 1: Build powers array (ascending order)
        java.util.List<Integer> powers = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) { // int max 2^30
            if ((n & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                powers.add(1 << i);
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Answer queries in array form
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        for (int q = 0; q < queries.length; q++) {
            int left = queries[q][0];
            int right = queries[q][1];
            long product = 1;

            for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
                product = (product * powers.get(i)) % MOD;
            }
            result[q] = (int) product;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PowersOfTwoQueries obj = new PowersOfTwoQueries();

        int n = 10;
        int[][] queries = { {0, 1}, {1, 1} };

        int[] ans = obj.productQueries(n, queries);

        for (int val : ans) {
            System.out.print(val + " ");
        }
        // Output: 16 8
    }
}
Changes made from earlier version
Now returns int[] instead of List<Long>.

Used powers as List<Integer> for easy index access.

Converted final product result to int since required return type is int[].

Added modulo in multiplication step to avoid overflow.

If you want, I can now optimize this by using prefix product array with modulo so that each query runs in O(1) instead of looping over each element in the range.
That will make it fast enough for n up to 10^5 and queries up to 10^5.

Do you want me to give you that optimized version next?
